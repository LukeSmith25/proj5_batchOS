current time is 0, the number of runnable processes is 0
a new process has started at time 0; we will give it id 0 and put it on the heap
running process id 0 at 0
there
current time is 9, the number of runnable processes is 0
moving the clock forward to 20 ticks since there are no processes to run
a new process has started at time 20; we will give it id 1 and put it on the heap
running process id 1 at 20
is
current time is 25, the number of runnable processes is 0
a new process has started at time 22; we will give it id 2 and put it on the heap
skipping process id 2 at 25
current time is 26, the number of runnable processes is 0
moving the clock forward to 29 ticks since there are no processes to run
a new process has started at time 29; we will give it id 3 and put it on the heap
skipping process id 3 at 29
current time is 30, the number of runnable processes is 0
moving the clock forward to 41 ticks since there are no processes to run
a new process has started at time 41; we will give it id 4 and put it on the heap
running process id 4 at 41
the
current time is 50, the number of runnable processes is 0
moving the clock forward to 58 ticks since there are no processes to run
a new process has started at time 58; we will give it id 5 and put it on the heap
running process id 5 at 58
right
current time is 67, the number of runnable processes is 0
a new process has started at time 60; we will give it id 6 and put it on the heap
running process id 6 at 67
tool
final clock is                 68
number of processes run is     5
number of processes skipped is 2
